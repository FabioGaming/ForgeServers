# A Collection of Minecraft Forge Server Files!

### Tired of the annoying process to setup a Minecraft server if you just want to play with friends?
This collection makes it easy to setup a Minecraft server, since with this collection you only need to Download a zip file and done!

#### Can I use this on Linux too?
Yes! This collection is made to setup servers on Windows and Linux, just make sure you have `screen` installed, if you use this on a Linux server!
You can install `screen` using: `apt-get install screen`. Also make sure the `start.sh` file is executable, you can do that using the `chmod` command.

#### Important information
For both Linux and Windows, make sure to have Java installed to run the servers properly

#### What if I don't have Forge installed?
A Forge installer will be included in each release.

#### How much RAM does a server use?
On average every `Start.bat` and `start.sh` is set to have a maximum of 8GB of RAM, you can change this by changing the number at `-Xmx8G`.

### How can I play with others?
If you drag the files to a public server, all people will need is the servers IP address. In case you host the server on your computer or any other local device in your network, you'll need a tunneling software to connect to others first, connected people then need to copy & paste your IPV4 address (NOTE: it has to be the IPV4 of the host device) into the Minecraft server bar
